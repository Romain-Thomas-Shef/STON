CHANGELOG
=========


24.11.16 : pylint as `github workflow <https://github.com/Romain-Thomas-Shef/STON/actions/workflows/pylint.yml>`_. This is triggered only of the code is modified. It will pass if the pylint score is higher than 9 and fail if it is below. Pylint 3.0.3 is used and uses a `local pylintrc file <https://github.com/Romain-Thomas-Shef/STON/blob/main/ston/pylintrc>`_.
